countdownDate.setDate(countdownDate.getDate() + 7); // Set to 7 days from now
```

You can modify this line to set a specific date or a different duration. For example:

To set a specific date ```(e.g., December 31, 2025, 10:00:00 AM):```


```const countdownDate = new Date("Dec 31, 2025 10:00:00").getTime();```

To set it for 30 days from now:
```
countdownDate.setDate(countdownDate.getDate() + 30);
```
